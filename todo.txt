1) Deal with noises :-

For example :- 

  In the training examples for the Hindi language, some sentences are in English script. Is this error or sentences can be in any script?

  This is a common noise in the datasets that you should deal with. We didn't add any artifacts on our own.
  
  How to tackle : Detect language of premise/hypothesis, and overwrite language in dataset
  
2) Combine similar languages together (Train together)

3) Fine tune model on en dataset

4) Crosscheck accuracy with translations pipeline

(IMPORTANT) 5) Train only on high resource language, English! (Finetune on high resource language at training). 
               At Test time, replace language adapter with language of choice, even better use attention of different adapters at inference and train attention! (Use low-resource langugaes to train attention)
